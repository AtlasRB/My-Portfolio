                    <p>Outside of coding something I love to do is climbing. Whether it's bouldering at the local gym or scaling outdoor rock faces, I find climbing to be a perfect blend of physical challenge and mental focus.</p>

                    <h2>Coding Journey</h2>
                    <p>I began my coding journey by teaching myself python. Through my own learning and personal projects I advanced my skills in problem solving and software development fundamentals.<br>
                    I enrolled in a 3-month program at IO, during which I learnt more about the world of web development.  mastering a range of languages and frameworks. I gained proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. <br>
                    My training at IO went further than just the basics, I learnt both React and Laravel. Through multiple projects, both alone and as part of a software development team, I became significantly more experienced in my software development abilities.</p>

                    <h2>My Upcoming Projects and Projects in Progress</h2>
                    <p>The project that I am currently working on is completing all coding problems on <a href="https://daily.dev/blog/fun-coding-problems-from-easy-to-hard" id="dailyDev">daily.dev</a>. 
                        I am completing all of the suggested projects on the daily.dev site in both python and JavaScript. The JavaScript project will be a React based project styled with Tailwind. It features a carousel designed layout to navigate between the projects. <br>
                    <br>I'm looking to create a site to use in my climbing hobby. This site will allow me to log climbs I complete and award 'points' depending on their difficulty. A backend system will be used for a user login database, as well as to log the users completed climbs and points.</p>
